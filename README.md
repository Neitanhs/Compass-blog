## Learnings 🎯

Before this challenge, I already had some experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript from other projects. However, adding TypeScript and implementing a rendering function made it quite challenging. I had no hesitation in admitting and understanding my difficulties because it only means there is more to learn. Thanks to the courses and the **COMPASS TEAM** ( _instructors and scrum masters_ ), I was able to learn:

- Working with multiple branches.
- Grid, Z-index, and -webkit functionality.
- Using TypeScript.
- Rendering functions.
- Using `Window.location` to retrieve information from the URL.
- Building a dynamic page generated based on the registered ID.
